# A History of Video Games

With this project I'm aiming to improve my C++ skills by building classic video games with C++ and SFML.
Further, I wanted to deepen my understanding of game development by making games without a game engine such as Unity or Unreal, but rather building them "from scratch". 

## Pong
The first game I re-created was Pong. 
Pong is a 2D game for two players where each player controls a paddle and has to deflect a ball back towards their opponent. 
A player scores once their opponent does not manage to return the ball and the ball leaves the screen behind the opposing player. 

With this game I wanted to get a first understanding of SFML and get back into writing object-oriented C++ code as well as project setup for C++ applications.
